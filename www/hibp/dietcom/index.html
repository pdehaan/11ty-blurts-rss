  In August 2014, the diet and nutrition website
  <a href="https://diet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diet.com</a>
  suffered a data breach resulting in the exposure of 1.4 million unique user
  records dating back as far as 2004. The data contained email and IP addresses,
  usernames, plain text passwords and dietary information about the site members
  including eating habits, BMI and birth date. The site was previously reported
  as compromised on the
  <a href="https://vigilante.pw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
