  In April 2018, the self-proclaimed &quot;biggest retro gaming website on
  earth&quot;, Emuparadise, suffered a data breach. The compromised vBulletin
  forum exposed 1.1 million email addresses, IP address, usernames and passwords
  stored as salted MD5 hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by
  <a href="https://dehashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehashed.com</a
