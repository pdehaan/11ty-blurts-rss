<p>In February 2016, the website for the Linux distro known as Linux Mint <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2016/02/linux-mint-hack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was hacked and the ISO infected with a backdoor</a>. The site also ran a phpBB forum which was subsequently put up for sale complete with almost 145k email addresses, passwords and other personal subscriber information.</p>
