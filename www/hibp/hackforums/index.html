<p>In June 2011, the hacktivist group known as "LulzSec" leaked <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/06/25/lulzsec-says-goodbye-dumping-nato-att-gamer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one final large data breach they titled "50 days of lulz"</a>. The compromised data came from sources such as AT&T, Battlefield Heroes and the <a href="http://hackforums.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hackforums.net website</a>.
