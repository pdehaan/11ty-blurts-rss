<p>In early 2020, the food delivery service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/home-chef-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Chef suffered a data breach</a> which was subsequently sold online. The breach exposed the personal information of almost 9 million customers including names, IP addresses, post codes, the last 4 digits of credit card numbers and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by <a href="https://dehashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehashed.com</a>.</p>
