  In approximately 2014, it's alleged that the Chinese Android store known as
  <a href="http://hiapk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIAPK</a> suffered
  a data breach that impacted 13.8 million unique subscribers. Whilst there is
  evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically
  verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;.
  The data in the breach contains usernames, email addresses and salted MD5
  password hashes and was provided to HIBP by white hat security researcher and
  data analyst Adam Davies.
