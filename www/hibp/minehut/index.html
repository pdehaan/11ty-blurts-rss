  In May 2019, the Minecraft server website
  <a href="https://minehut.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minehut</a>
  suffered a data breach. The company advised a database backup had been
  obtained after which they subsequently notified all impacted users. 397k email
  addresses from the incident were provided to HIBP. A data set with both email
  addresses and bcrypt password hashes was also later provided to HIBP.
