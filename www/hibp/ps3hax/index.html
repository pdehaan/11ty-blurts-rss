  In approximately July 2015, the Sony Playstation hacks and mods forum known as
  <a href="http://www.ps3hax.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS3Hax</a> was
  hacked and more than 447k accounts were exposed. The vBulletin forum included
  IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation
  enabling many to be rapidly cracked.
