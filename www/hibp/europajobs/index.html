<p>In August 2019, the now defunct European jobs website <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Qk_zaGEqx70J:https://en.europa.jobs/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">europa.jobs</a> (Google cache link) suffered a data breach. The incident exposed 226k unique email addresses alongside extensive personal information including names, dates of birth, job applications and passwords. The data was subsequently redistributed on a popular hacking forum.</p>
