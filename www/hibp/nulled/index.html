  In May 2016, the cracking community forum known as
  <a href="http://nulled.cr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nulled.cr</a> was
  hacked and 599k user accounts were leaked publicly. The compromised data
  included email and IP addresses, weak salted MD5 password hashes and hundreds
  of thousands of private messages between members.
