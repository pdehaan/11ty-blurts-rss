<p>In June 2011 as part of a final breached data dump, the hacker collective &quot;LulzSec&quot; <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/06/26/lulzsec-over-release-battlefield-heroes-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained and released over half a million usernames and passwords from the game Battlefield Heroes</a>. The passwords were stored as MD5 hashes with no salt and many were easily converted back to their plain text versions.</p>
