  In September 2016, data was allegedly obtained from the Chinese website known
  as
  <a href="http://www.uuu9.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uuu9.com</a> and
  contained 7.5M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate,
  due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been
  flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;. The data in the breach contains email
  addresses and user names.
