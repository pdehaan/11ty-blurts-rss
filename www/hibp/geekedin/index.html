<p>In August 2016, the technology recruitment site <a href="http://geekedin.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeekedIn</a> left a MongoDB database exposed and over 8M records were extracted by an unknown third party. The breached data was originally scraped from GitHub in violation of their terms of use and contained information exposed in public profiles, including over 1 million members' email addresses. Full details on the incident (including how impacted members can see their leaked data) are covered in the blog post on <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/8-million-github-profiles-were-leaked-from-geekedins-mongodb-heres-how-to-see-yours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8 million GitHub profiles were leaked from GeekedIn's MongoDB - here's how to see yours</a>.</p>
