  In approximately mid 2015, the music tracking app
  <a href="http://www.soundwave.com/help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Soundwave suffered a data breach</a
  >. The breach stemmed from an incident whereby &quot;production data had been
  used to populate the test database&quot; and was then inadvertently exposed in
  a MongoDB. The data contained 130k records and included email addresses, dates
  of birth, genders and MD5 hashes of passwords without a salt.
