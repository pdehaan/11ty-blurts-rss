  In late 2011, data was allegedly obtained from the Chinese website known as
  <a href="http://dodonew.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dodonew.com</a>
  and contained 8.7M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is
  legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach
  it has been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;. The data in the breach contains
  email addresses and user names.
