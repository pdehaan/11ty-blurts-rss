  In mid-2011, data was allegedly obtained from the Chinese engineering website
  known as
  <a href="http://www.co188.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Civil Online</a
  >
  and contained 7.8M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is
  legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach
  it has been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;. The data in the breach contains
  email and IP addresses, user names and MD5 password hashes.
