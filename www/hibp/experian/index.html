<p>In September 2015, the US based credit bureau and consumer data broker <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/10/experian-breach-affects-15-million-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experian suffered a data breach</a> that impacted 15 million customers who had applied for financing from T-Mobile. An alleged data breach was subsequently circulated containing personal information including names, physical and email addresses, birth dates and various other personal attributes. Multiple Have I Been Pwned subscribers verified portions of the data as being accurate, but the actual source of it was inconclusive therefor this breach has been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;.</p>
