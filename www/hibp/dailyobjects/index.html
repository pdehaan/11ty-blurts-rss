  In approximately January 2018, a collection of more than 464k customer records
  from the Indian online retailer
  <a href="https://www.dailyobjects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >DailyObjects</a
  >
  were leaked online. The data included names, physical and email addresses,
  phone numbers and &quot;pincodes&quot; stored in plain text. After multiple
  attempts to contact them, DailyObjects responded and received a copy of the
  data for verification, however failed to respond to multiple contact attempts
  following that.
