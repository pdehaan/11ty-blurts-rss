  In late 2015, the gaming website
  <a href="https://www.r2games.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R2Games</a>
  was hacked and more than 2.1M personal records disclosed. The vBulletin forum
  included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak
  implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked. A further 11M accounts
  were added to "Have I Been Pwned" in March 2016 and another 9M in July 2016
  bringing the total to over 22M.
