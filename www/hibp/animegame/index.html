  In February 2020, the gaming website
  <a href="http://animegame.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnimeGame</a>
  suffered a data breach. The incident affected 1.4M subscribers and exposed
  email addresses, usernames and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes. The data
  was subsequently shared on a popular hacking forum and was provided to HIBP by
