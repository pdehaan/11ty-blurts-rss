<p>In October 2018, <a href="https://blog.hacken.io/how-sensitive-is-your-non-sensitive-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Bob Diachenko identified multiple exposed databases with hundreds of millions of records</a>. One of those datasets was an Elasticsearch instance on AWS containing sales lead data and 5.8M unique email addresses. The data contained information relating to individuals and the companies they worked for including their names, email addresses and company name and contact information. Despite best efforts, it was not possible to identify the owner of the data hence this breach as been titled &quot;Elasticsearch Sales Leads&quot;.</p>
