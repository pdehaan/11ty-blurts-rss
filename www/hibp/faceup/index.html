  In 2013, the Danish social media site
  <a href="https://faceup.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FaceUP</a>
  suffered a data breach. The incident exposed 87k unique email addresses
  alongside genders, dates of birth, names, phone numbers and passwords stored
  as unsalted MD5 hashes. When notified of the incident, FaceUP advised they had
  identified a SQL injection vulnerability at the time and forced password
  resets on impacted customers.
