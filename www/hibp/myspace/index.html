<p>In approximately 2008, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/427-million-myspace-passwords-emails-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySpace suffered a data breach that exposed almost 360 million accounts</a>. In May 2016 the data was offered up for sale on the &quot;Real Deal&quot; dark market website and included email addresses, usernames and SHA1 hashes of the first 10 characters of the password converted to lowercase and stored without a salt. The exact breach date is unknown, but <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis of the data suggests it was 8 years before being made public</a>.</p>
