  discovered the leak contained multiple terabytes of personal information
  spread across hundreds of separate fields including addresses, phone numbers,
  family structures and extensive profiling data. The data was collected as part
  of Exactis' service as a &quot;compiler and aggregator of premium business
  &amp; consumer data&quot; which they then sell for profiling and marketing
  purposes. A small subset of the exposed fields were provided to Have I Been
  Pwned and contained 132 million unique email addresses.
