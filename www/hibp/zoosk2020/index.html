  which was subsequently shared extensively across online hacking communities.
  The breach contained 24 million unique email addresses alongside extensive
  personal information including genders, sexualities, dates of birth, physical
  attributes such as height and weight, religions, ethnicities and political
  views. The breach also allegedly exposed MD5 password hashes, although the
  data circulating in hacking circles had this field nulled out. The breach was
  provided to HIBP by
