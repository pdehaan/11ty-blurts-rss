  In approximately February 2015, the Xbox forum known as
  <a href="http://xboxscene.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox-Scene</a>
  was hacked and more than 432k accounts were exposed. The IP.Board forum
  included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak
  implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked.
