  In March 2015, the anime and manga forum
  <a href="http://www.hongfire.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HongFire</a>
  suffered a data breach. The hack of their vBulletin forum led to the exposure
  of 1 million accounts along with email and IP addresses, usernames, dates of
  birth and salted MD5 passwords.
