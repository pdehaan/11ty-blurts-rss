  In May 2013, the torrent site
  <a href="http://www.ahashare.com">AhaShare.com</a> suffered a breach which
  resulted in more than 180k user accounts being published publicly. The breach
  included a raft of personal information on registered users plus despite
  assertions of not distributing personally identifiable information, the site
  also leaked the IP addresses used by the registered identities.
