  In approximately February 2016, data surfaced which was allegedly obtained
  from
  <a href="http://vtightgel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >V-Tight Gel (vaginal tightening gel)</a
  >. Whilst the data set was titled V-Tight, within there were
  <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/pN7nyjJ7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >50 other (predominantly wellness-related) domain names</a
  >, most owned by the same entity. Multiple HIBP subscribers confirmed that
  although they couldn't recall providing data specifically to V-Tight, their
  personal information including name, phone and physical address was accurate.
  V-Tight Gel did not reply to multiple requests for comment.
