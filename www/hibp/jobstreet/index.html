<p>In October 2017, the Malaysian website <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2017/145654/personal-data-millions-malaysians-sale-source-breach-still-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowyat.net ran a story on a massive set of breached data affecting millions of Malaysians</a> after someone posted it for sale on their forums. The data spanned multiple separate breaches including <a href="https://www.jobstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the JobStreet jobs website</a> which contained almost 4 million unique email addresses. The dates in the breach indicate the incident occurred in March 2012. The data later appeared freely downloadable on a Tor hidden service and contained extensive information on job seekers including names, genders, birth dates, phone numbers, physical addresses and passwords.</p>
