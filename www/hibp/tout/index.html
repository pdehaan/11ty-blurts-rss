  In approximately September 2014, the now defunct social networking service
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tout_(company)"
    target="_blank"

    >Tout</a

  suffered a data breach. The breach subsequently appeared years later and
  included 653k unique email addresses, names, IP addresses, the location of the
  user, their bio and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. The data was provided
  to HIBP by a source who requested it to be attributed to
  &quot;nmapthis@protonmail.com&quot;.
