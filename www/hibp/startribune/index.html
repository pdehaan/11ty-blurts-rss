<p>In October 2019, the Minnesota-based news service <a href="https://www.startribune.com/hacker-group-claims-to-have-stolen-star-tribune-user-information/570384542/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StarTribune suffered a data breach</a> which was subsequently sold on the dark web. The breach exposed over 2 million unique email addresses alongside names, usernames, physical addresses, dates of birth, genders and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by <a href="https://dehashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehashed.com</a>.</p>
