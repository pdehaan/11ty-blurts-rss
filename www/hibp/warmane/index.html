  In approximately December 2016, the online service for World of Warcraft
  private servers
  <a href="https://www.warmane.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warmane</a>
  suffered a data breach. The incident exposed over 1.1M accounts including
  usernames, email addresses, dates of birth and salted MD5 password hashes. The
  data was subsequently extensively circulated online and was later provided to
  HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies.
