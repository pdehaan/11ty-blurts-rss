<p>In approximately August 2013, the World of Warcraft exploits forum known as <a href="http://www.ownedcore.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OwnedCore</a> was hacked and more than 880k accounts were exposed. The vBulletin forum included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked.</p>
