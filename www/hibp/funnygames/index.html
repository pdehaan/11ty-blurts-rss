  In April 2018, the online entertainment site
  <a href="https://www.funny-games.biz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Funny Games</a
  >
  suffered a data breach that disclosed 764k records including usernames, email
  and IP addresses and salted MD5 password hashes. The incident was disclosed to
  Funny Games in July who acknowledged the breach and identified it had been
  caused by legacy code no longer in use. The record count in the breach
  constitute approximately half of the user base.
