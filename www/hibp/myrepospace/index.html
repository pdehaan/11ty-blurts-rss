  <a href="https://myrepospace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >myRepoSpace</a

  was hacked and

    >user data leaked publicly</a
  >. Cydia is designed to facilitate the installation of apps on jailbroken iOS
  devices. The repository service was allegedly hacked by
  <a href="https://twitter.com/its_not_herpes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >@its_not_herpes</a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/0x8badfl00d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

  in retaliation for the service refusing to remove pirated tweaks.
