<p>In May 2015, the <a href="http://www.databreaches.net/minecraft-pocket-edition-forum-hacked-dumped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Pocket Edition forum was hacked</a> and over 16k accounts were dumped public. Allegedly hacked by <a href="https://twitter.com/rmsg0d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@rmsg0d</a>, the forum data included numerous personal pieces of data for each user. The forum has subsequently been decommissioned.</p>
