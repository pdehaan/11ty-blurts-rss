    >Lumin PDF suffered a data breach</a
  >. The breach wasn't publicly disclosed until September when 15.5M records of
  user data appeared for download on a popular hacking forum. The data had been
  left publicly exposed in a MongoDB instance after which Lumin PDF was
  allegedly been &quot;contacted multiple times, but ignored all the
  queries&quot;. The exposed data included names, email addresses, genders,
  spoken language and either a bcrypt password hash or Google auth token. The
  data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to
  &quot;JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com&quot;.
