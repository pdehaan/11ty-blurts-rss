<p>In November 2018, the WordPress sandboxing service that allows people to create temporary websites <a href="https://wpsandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Sandbox</a> discovered their service was being used to host a phishing site attempting to collect Microsoft OneDrive accounts. After identifying the malicious site, WP Sandbox took it offline, contacted the 858 people who provided information to it then self-submitted their addresses to HIBP. The phishing page requested both email addresses and passwords.</p>
