  In January 2019, a large collection of credential stuffing lists (combinations
  of email addresses and passwords used to hijack accounts on other services)
  was discovered being distributed on a popular hacking forum. The data
  contained almost 2.7 <em>billion</em> records including 773 million unique
  email addresses alongside passwords those addresses had used on other breached
  services. Full details on the incident and how to search the breached
  passwords are provided in the blog post
