<p>In December 2010, Gawker was attacked by the hacker collective &quot;Gnosis&quot; in retaliation for what was reported to be a feud between Gawker and 4Chan. Information about Gawkers 1.3M users was published along with the data from Gawker's other web presences including Gizmodo and Lifehacker.
