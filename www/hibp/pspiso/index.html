<p>In approximately September 2015, the PlayStation PSP forum known as <a href="http://www.pspiso.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSP ISO</a> was hacked and almost 1.3 million accounts were exposed. Along with email and IP addresses, the vBulletin forum also exposed salted MD5 password hashes.</p>
