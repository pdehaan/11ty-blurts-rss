<p>In November 2019, the Vietnamese education website <a href="https://tailieu.vn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TaiLieu</a> allegedly suffered a data breach exposing 7.3M customer records. Impacted data included names and usernames, email addresses, dates of birth, genders and passwords stored as unsalted MD5 hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by <a href="https://dehashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehashed.com</a> after being shared on a popular hacking forum. TaiLieu did not respond when contacted about the incident.</p>
