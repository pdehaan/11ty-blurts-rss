<p>In July 2016, a tweet was posted with a link to an alleged data breach of <a href="http://bluesnap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueSnap, a global payment gateway and merchant account provider</a>. The data contained 324k payment records across 105k unique email addresses and included personal attributes such as name, home address and phone number. The data was verified with multiple Have I Been Pwned subscribers who confirmed it also contained valid transactions, partial credit card numbers, expiry dates and CVVs. A downstream consumer of BlueSnap services known as <a href="http://www.regpacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regpack</a> was subsequently identified as the source of the data after they identified human error had left the transactions exposed on a publicly facing server. A full investigation of the data and statement by Regpack is detailed in the post titled <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/someone-just-lost-324k-payment-records-complete-with-cvvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Someone just lost 324k payment records, complete with CVVs</a>.</p>
