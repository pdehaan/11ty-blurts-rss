  In August 2018, the Roblox trading site
  <a href="https://rbx.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rbx.Rocks</a>
  suffered a data breach. Almost 25k records were sent to HIBP in November and
  included names, email addresses and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. In July
  2019, a further 125k records emerged bringing the total size of the incident
  to 150k. The website has since gone offline with a message stating that
  &quot;Rbx.Rocks v2.0 is currently under construction&quot;.
