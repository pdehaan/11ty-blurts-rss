<p>In August 2018, the spyware company <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kmj4v/spyware-company-spyfone-terabytes-data-exposed-online-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpyFone left terabytes of data publicly exposed</a>. Collected surreptitiously whilst the targets were using their devices, the data included photos, audio recordings, text messages and browsing history which were then exposed via a number of misconfigurations within SpyFone's systems. The data belonged the thousands of SpyFone customers and included 44k unique email addresses, many likely belonging to people the targeted phones had contact with.</p>
