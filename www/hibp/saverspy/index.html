    >security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered a massive collection of
    personal details exposed in an unprotected Mongo DB instance</a

  spam purposes) but had little identifying data about it other than a
  description of &quot;Yahoo_090618_ SaverSpy&quot;. The data set provided to
  HIBP had almost 2.5M unique email addresses (all of which were from Yahoo!)
  alongside names, genders and physical addresses.
