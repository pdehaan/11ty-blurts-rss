  In July 2018, staff of
  <a href="https://lanwar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >the Lanwar gaming site</a
  >
  discovered a data breach they believe dates back to sometime over the previous
  several months. The data contained 45k names, email addresses, usernames and
  plain text passwords. A Lanwar staff member self-submitted the breach to HIBP
  and has also contacted the relevant authorities about the incident after
  identifying a phishing attempt to extort Bitcoin from a user.
