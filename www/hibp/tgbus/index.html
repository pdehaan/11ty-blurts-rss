  In approximately 2017, it's alleged that the Chinese gaming site known as
  <a href="http://www.tgbus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TGBUS</a>
  suffered a data breach that impacted over 10 million unique subscribers.
  Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of
  emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as
  &quot;unverified&quot;. The data in the breach contains usernames, email
  addresses and salted MD5 password hashes and was provided with support from
  <a href="https://dehashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehashed.com</a
  >.
